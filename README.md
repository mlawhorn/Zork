# Zork

This project is a console based text game in which a player navigates through a dungeon. The dungeon will have anywhere from 5 to 10 cells, with a random probability of encountering a monster and coming across a weapon. Inputs and outputs are managed using JOptionPane. The object is to get through the dungeon alive, with the possibility of dying and getting a game over.

This project demonstrates the use of classes, JOptionPane, input and output, and inheritance.
